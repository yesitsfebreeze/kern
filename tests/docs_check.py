"""Verify the docs' references are alive: every `src/...:line` citation points
at a real file and an existing line, every backticked repo path names a file
that exists, every relative page link points at a page that exists, and every
link into this repo's own files on GitHub names a file that is actually
committed. Exit 1 with a report if anything is dead.

Scans every documentation directory the repo has — the site, `docs/kern/`,
`docs/oracle/` and `README.md` — because a citation nobody checks is a citation
that rots. Existence is the only thing it can *fail* on.

Two escapes, because some citations are *supposed* to name a file that is gone.
A page carrying `<!-- docs-check: historical -->` is skipped whole: a changelog
entry recording a deletion must cite the deleted file, and a point-in-time note
describes the tree as it was. A single line naming a deletion is excused in
place, so a present-tense page can still say what it removed.

Beyond existence there is a second, weaker question: does the cited line still
*say* the thing it was cited for? A line anchor is a bet that nothing is ever
inserted above it, and appending to a growing file loses that bet silently —
the line still exists, it just says something else now. So every anchor with a
line number also gets a content check: the words of the citing bullet against
the words of the cited line(s). Near-zero overlap is *nominated*, not failed.
Short targets legitimately score low, and a checker that cries wolf gets turned
off, so nominations are printed under their own heading and leave the exit code
alone. `--strict-anchors` makes them fatal for a CI that has decided to trust
them. A nomination a human has adjudicated is silenced in place with a trailing
`docs-check: anchor-ok` comment, in the same idiom as the historical marker."""
