"""ROADMAP item 21: the review lifecycle, end to end through the binary.

The hold and the release are one feature and neither half is worth anything
alone — a host that can hold a claim but never release it strands it, and a
`promote` with no way to filter releases something nobody could have hidden. So
this walks the whole loop: `[ingest] review_policy = { inline = "pending" }`
holds every CLI ingest, `query --exclude-pending` must miss it, `kern promote`
must release it, and the same query must then return it.

Unlike item 18's `principals`, none of this needs a JSON-RPC client: the policy
is ordinary config and both verbs are subprocess-visible, so the routed path and
the NoDaemon fallback are each measurable. Both are measured, for the reason
`test_graviton_routing` gives — a mutating CLI path that writes locally beside a
serving daemon releases the claim in a copy the daemon's next persist overwrites,
and the row reads as promoted while it is still held.
