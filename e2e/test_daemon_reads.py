"""The read half of ROADMAP item 9: `get` and `query` go through a serving
daemon, and fall back to the local store only when nothing is serving.

The proof needs the daemon's answer to be one no local read could have produced.
A daemon reads its config once, at startup, and then holds its store open — so
rewriting `.kern/kern.toml` to name an empty `data_dir` blinds every *later* CLI
process without moving the graph the daemon is already serving. From that point
on, anything the CLI prints came over the socket.

`search` and `list` stay local by decision (item 9 notes), which is what makes
them the control here: with the config repointed they must go blind in the same
breath that `get` and `query` still answer.
